Had a lot of trouble with this one. I tried different approaches but they didn't work for the second one. Basically I wanted to capture all the `mul(x,y)` between `do()` and `don't()`. This didn't work and I don't really know why. I did think about adding a `do()` at the start and a `don't()` at the end but this wasn't enough to make it work.

So instead I wrote a small parser. First I filtered to keep only `do()`, `don't()` and `mul(x,y)`. I used regexes as I know regexes, and Rust doesn't have a `scanf`-like in the standard library (to be fair regexes aren't in the standard library either). After extracting only what I needed, I tokenized (three tokens, `Token::Do`, `Token::Dont`, `Token::Mul(i32,i32)`). Then after that it's a simple for loop. To tokenize I implemented `FromStr` for `Token`, again using regexes for the `Mul`. This was kind of slow and I figured that like in Go, maybe creating the regex at each function call takes a lot of time. I searched for how to initialize it only once, used `lazy_static` and now it's not slow anymore (from ~1 second for cargo run to ~0.03 seconds).
